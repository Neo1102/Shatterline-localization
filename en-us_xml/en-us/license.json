This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:<div class='Br'></div>o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) <div class='Br'></div>o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<div class='Br'></div>o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')<div class='Br2'></div>We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<div class='Br'></div>Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:<div class='Br2'></div>\"Portions of this software are copyright © 2013 The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.\"<div class='Br'></div>Legal Terms<div class='Br'></div>0. Definitions<div class='Br'></div>Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.<div class='Br'></div>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.<div class='Br'></div>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.

We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<div class='Br2'></div>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.<div class='Br2'></div>3.
